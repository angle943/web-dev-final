            It&apos;s truly an exciting time to be a Frontend Developer! Next.js
            recently announced version 13.4, which made the new &ldquo;App
            Router&rdquo; paradigm stable, and React is preparing to release
            their brand new server side components with React@19. This new
            server-side approach to React will completely change how React apps
            are built, and result in an experience to the end users that are
            much more fluid and performant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is, however, where can you learn these new techniques?
            Virtually all courses at the time of this writing is for the old way
            of writing React and Next.js patterns. That is why we are so pleased
            to announce our brand new courses on React and Next.js!
          </p>
          <p>
            We have completely overhauled our courses from the ground up to be
            server-side first. We have been using these server-side components
            for quite a while now in our jobs, and we have learned quite a bit
            about them, and we want to transfer our learnings onto our students.
          </p>
          <p>
            So don&apos;t delay in checking out our brand new courses, and be
            the industry lead in this new paradigm!

          <p>
            There are so many languages popping out these days. And if you are
            part of the vast online developer community, there are some
            languages that are hot while others are not. Some popular
            backend-focused languages these days (at the time of this writing)
            seem to be Rust, Go, Node.js, and Zig. Some of the languages that
            gets scoffed at are languages like Java and PHP. We will not make
            the future attempt to defend PHP in this article, but Java we will.
          </p>
          <h4>It is Used by big tech companies such as FAANG</h4>
          <p>
            The number 1 language used by Google and Amazon is Java. Java is
            also heavily used by most non-Microsoft companies (such as Meta and
            Netflix). And due to this, learning Java is one of the safest bet if
            you want to get a job as a backend developer. You might think that
            languages like Rust and Go will make older languages like Java
            irrelevant, but do a quick search in your local market. Especially
            if you are in the US, I am willing to bet that Java jobs will
            outweigh Rust/Go jobs more than 20 to 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if it becomes irrelevant in a few short years you might
            ask? That is simply not how programming works. Companies as big as
            Google and Amazon simply can&apos;t change their main language
            overnight. And frankly, they have no need to.
          </p>
          <h4>Java continues to evolve.</h4>
          <p>
            Java is heavily vested by the biggest companies. As an example,
            Amazon currently employs James Gosling, the founder of Java. Due to
            this, these big tech companies invest heavily into the language,
            which allows it to continue to evolve and grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Java today is not the same as Java 5 years ago. And Java 5 years
            from now will surely have a lot of new features that we currently
            don&apos;t have. So while admittedly Java have some archaic syntax
            which makes programming in it a bit verbose, it will continue to
            evolve and get better over time.
          </p>
          <h4>It is battle-tested</h4>
          <p>
            One of the benefits of big tech companies being so invested into a
            language is that it is truly battle tested. Any security
            vulnerabilities that might exist within the language is quickly
            found out and fixed. Therefore, you can rest assure that going with
            Java is a safe bet
          </p>
          <h4>Try out our Java course!</h4>
          <p>
            Due to the above reasons and much more, we are very much invested in
            helping our students learn Java, even if it may not be the shiniest
            language. So check out our course page and check out our various
            Java course offerings!

          <p>
            There are literally hundreds of resources these days on learning how
            to become a developer. So why should you choose the ACDX experience
            over the rest? In this article we will explore why you should
            consider using ACDX to jumpstart your programming journey over the
            competition.
          </p>
          <h4>It is proven to work.</h4>
          <p>
            The first point is probably the most important. But we have over
            10,000 students, and we have received thousands of glowing reviews.
            We have testimonials from people switching to become a web developer
            from an unrelated field, and landing their 6 figure jobs after
            studying with us. We have stories from junior and mid-level
            developers studying and finally landing that dream job at a big tech
            company like Google and Meta.
          </p>
          <h4>We have a community of over 10,000 students</h4>
          <p>
            We will be honest. As much as we as the instructors of this program
            want always be available to all of our students, we just cannot
            guarantee that we can help every single person whenever they get
            stuck or have questions. And although there are programs available
            that can offer this (in-person bootcamps), you will end up spending
            around $20,000 and only be able to interact with the teachers for
            about 3 months. That is simply too expensive, and 3 months is not
            enough of a time for you to excel.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is where our community comes into play. We have thousands of
            students always active in our community, and you are always a
            question away from getting the help that you need and deserve. We
            have a dedicated discussion area for all topics of all courses for
            you to post questions. We have a rewards mechanism for people that
            give helpful responses to incentive-ize the community to provide
            help, which not only helps the student asking the question, but also
            those that answer the question (teaching is one of the best ways to
            learn).
          </p>
          <p>
            For more general questions, you will also receive an invitation to
            our members-only slack channel. You can interact with not just the
            thousands of students studying alongside you, but you will find that
            the instructors are quite active as well.
          </p>
          <h4>We are actually interested in helping you learn</h4>
          <p>
            One of the problems we see today is that many of the courses we see
            on the web holds your hand too much. You, as a student, might feel
            great while taking the course as you build (copy?) all these cool
            projects that is being &ldquo;taught&rdquo; by the instructor, but
            when the course is over and you try doing something on your own, you
            quickly realize you have not learned much.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing projects for self growth is important, and that is why we
            take a different approach to this. We simulate a real like job by
            giving you product requirements as well as UI/UX mocks, and
            encourage you to try to implement it from there.
